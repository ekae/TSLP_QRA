# TSLP optimization

The Two Step Linear Programming or TSLP is an optimization method for quantum repeater allocation problem, regarding to A Two-Step Linear Programming Approach for Efficient Repeater Placement in
Quantum Networks research article. The code uses of various Python-based library relate to graph and optimization technique. The graph_toolpy contains function for generate and manipulate graph data. The tslp.py offers two main optimization functionalities: Feed Forward Minimum-Cost Flow and Path Traversal optimization. The Minimum-Cost Flow feature calculates the best path between end nodes pairs through a network, considering factors such as path length and Lmax. On the other hand, the Path Traversal optimization identifies the optimal locations for repeater nodes to ensure quantum communication coverage.

To use the TSLP Tool, start by generate or import graph object. Then initilize both LpFeedForwardMinCostFlow and LpPathTraversal class, depending on your optimization requirements. Provide the necessary input parameters such as the network graph, end nodes, and any additional constraints. Once the instance is initialized, call the solve method to execute the optimization process. You can enable logging to track the progress and inspect the results. An example of simulation code is in run_sim.py

The tool relies on the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) for graph data,  [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/12) linear programming library and the [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) solver for efficient optimization. Make sure to install these dependencies before using the Network Optimization Tool.
